# Document Semantic

_Inspired by SemVer, tailored for clear and concise document management in Markdown format._

The inception of Document Semantic was driven by the need to maintain effective document control within GIT, specifically for Markdown files. While GIT is adept at tracking code changes, traditional document formats aren't always suitable for text-based diffing. Markdown, being text-based, integrates seamlessly with GIT, allowing for precise tracking of changes. The introduction of concise short codes ensures that document updates are both meaningful and GIT-friendly. While GIT and Markdown were the primary motivations, this approach is versatile and can benefit a range of documentation use cases.

## Major Semantic Increment

Significant changes that might confuse readers familiar with a previous version.

- **MCHG**: Meaning Change - Fundamental alterations to the document's primary content.
- **SRMV**: Section Removal - Entire sections or content are taken out.
- **BSTR**: Big Structure Change - Drastic reorganization of the document's layout.
- **DCHG**: Definition Change - Key terminologies or definitions are updated.
- **FCHG**: Format Change - The medium or visual presentation of the document is transformed.

## Minor Semantic Increment

Additions or updates that don't modify the core content but enhance its comprehensiveness.

- **NSEC**: New Section - Introducing fresh content or chapters.
- **SMAT**: Supplementary Material - Inclusion of additional resources or references.
- **SSTR**: Small Structure Change - Minor tweaks in the document's organization.
- **GENH**: Graphic Enhancement - Improvements to visuals, diagrams, or illustrations.
- **CUPD**: Clarity Update - Providing clearer explanations or expanding on existing content.

## Patch Semantic Increment

Corrections and enhancements that focus on refining the document's quality.

- **TFIX**: Typographical Fix - Correcting spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors.
- **FUPD**: Footnote Update - Clarifications or updates to references and footnotes.
- **DCOR**: Data Correction - Rectifying any inaccurate data or information.
- **LADJ**: Layout Adjustment - Subtle changes to design or formatting for better readability.
- **LFIX**: Link Fix - Repairing broken links or missing assets.

### Short Codes
The short codes, concise in nature, capture the essence of each change, simplifying communication about document updates. Adopting a standardized semantic system for documents ensures clarity, efficiency, and collaboration.
